# src/sim — Riley31415/wuwa_calc inside Wuthering Tools+

`/rankings` hosts Riley's team comparison table and rotation detail pages (his GitHub Pages site)
inside this app's layout. His code is **not copied**: it is the git submodule `vendor/wuwa_calc`,
imported through the Vite alias `@skittle/*` and compiled by Vite straight from his TypeScript.

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `vendor/wuwa_calc` | the submodule (pinned commit); `git -C vendor/wuwa_calc pull` to update, then `node scripts/skittle-sync.mjs` |
| `skittle-modules.d.ts` | `declare module "@skittle/*"` — vue-tsc never type-checks his sources (his tsconfig differs) |
| `skittle.css` | GENERATED: his `resources/index.css` with every selector scoped under `.skittle-root` (`.pop`, `.ctxmenu`, `body.coldrag` stay global because he appends those to `document.body`) |
| `rankings/controller.ts` | port of his `src/index.ts`: builds the DOM his page modules cache at import time (`#app`, `#topbar`, `#backLink`, `#loading`) inside a persistent `.skittle-root`, imports his modules lazily, runs his solve/run passes, routes detail views through vue-router |
| `rankings/solver.worker.ts` | worker entry: importing his `solver.ts` registers `onmessage` |
| `public/tests/solves/*.json` | GENERATED: his precomputed solves; his page fetches `./tests/solves/…` relative to `/rankings` |
| `public/sim/loading.gif` | GENERATED: the overlay sticker |
| `skittle-theme.css` | hand-written theme bridge (phase B2): re-derives his `--bg/--surface/--ink/--accent…` variables from DaisyUI's tokens (`oklch(var(--b1))` etc.) on `.skittle-root`, `.pop` and `.ctxmenu`, sets the app font, and darkens kit colours / hard-coded whites on `[data-theme-style="light"]` — so the page follows every app theme |
| `src/pages/RankingsView.vue` | the page: `<Nav>` + host div + credit line; claims `100vw` so AppLayout's content-sized `.contain` grid (and the update banner) span the viewport |

Things learned the hard way:
- Vue's root is `#wt-app` (index.html / main.ts) so that `#app` is free for his container.
- His `loadSolves()` probes `/__livereload`; any SPA host answers 200 with index.html, which would skip the
  shipped solves and re-solve 625 teams in the browser. The controller answers that one fetch with a 404.
- His `paint()` awaits two `requestAnimationFrame`s; rAF never fires in a background tab or headless
  Electron, so the port races it against an 80 ms timeout.
- His `body`/`html` rules become `.skittle-root { height: 100vh }` after scoping — the page's `!important`
  overrides size it to the host instead.
- AppLayout's `.contain` is a content-sized grid: a page narrower than the viewport shrinks the grid (and the
  update banner) to its own width. The rankings page sets `width: 100vw`.
- Visual checks: `node ~/Projects/wuwa-tools/scripts/shot.mjs http://localhost:5173/rankings --theme light --out x.png`
  (headless-Chromium DevTools screenshot; Cypress's `cy.screenshot()` hangs in this sandbox).
- Cypress smoke spec: `cypress/e2e/rankings.cy.ts` (CI shard `plus` = every root-level `cypress/e2e/*.cy.ts`).
  CI must check out submodules (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`): without `vendor/wuwa_calc` the lazy `/rankings`
  chunk fails to resolve `@skittle/*`, the page (and its Nav) never mounts, and the spec times out.
- Updating Riley: `~/Projects/wuwa-tools/scripts/sync-skittle.sh [--push]`.

## Stock presets from wuwa_calc (phase C) — `src/sim/presets/`

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | loaders: `loadWuwaCalcRotationPresets(key)` (one lazy JSON chunk per character via `import.meta.glob`; appended to the curated list by `CalculatorRotations.vue` for the Rotation presets modal and by `TeamRotationTeamEditor.vue` for the team-slot import dialog — the calculator engine and `getCharByName` never touch them), `loadWuwaCalcTeamPresets()` (lazy `data/teams.json`, joined to the curated list the first time Teams > List Presets opens) |
| `data/rotations/<Key>.json` | GENERATED — `CharacterRotationPreset[]` per character: the top steady-state loops Riley's engine ran for that resonator in each solver state (see below), team-dependent variants included (e.g. Xuanling's 3 vs 5 "Still as Withered Wood" shadows), mapped onto this app's attack keys; identical action lists across states are emitted once |
| `data/teams.json` | GENERATED — `TeamRotationPreset[]`: per solver state, for every main DPS the app knows, the best 3 distinct compositions, the three rotations interleaved in execution order, main DPS in slot 0, enemy = level 100 / 20% RES (Riley's target) |
| `data/manifest.json` | GENERATED — provenance (`wuwaCalcCommit`, `appCommit`, state, timestamp) and counts |
| `wuwaCalcPresets.test.ts` | gate: every generated action resolves on its character through `resolveRotationActionToAttackData`, names unique and disjoint from the curated presets, every team a complete 3-slot team |

Generator: `~/Projects/wuwa-tools/rotation-port/emit_app_presets.py --states s6r5,s6r5mdps,s6r1mdps` (after
`export_rotations.mjs <state>` → `dump_app_tables.ts` → `map_rotations.py --state <state>` per state, see that README).
Solver states shipped: **S6R5** (everyone S6, R5 signatures), **S6R5 DPS · S0R1 team** and **S6R1 DPS · S0R1 team**
(only the main DPS S6, everyone else S0 with R1 weapons — the realistic case when supports aren't S6/R5); names
carry the state tag, and each character preset's name states that character's own sequence and weapon. Never hand-edit `data/`. Casts the app has no action for are listed in each
preset's description as "Not ported" (as of 2026-09-11: the echoes Oblivion / Core of Collapse / Hecate, Cantarella's
"Beneath the Sea", one forte heavy). Kit multipliers Riley folds into his motion values (Hiyuki, Cantarella, Brant,
Galbrena, …) are mapped by ratio — the app applies them through the kit's buffs, so keep those enabled.
E2E: `cypress/e2e/wuwaCalcPresets.cy.ts`. Credit: author field `Riley31415 (wuwa_calc)` on every preset.
