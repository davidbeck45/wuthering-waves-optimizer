# src/sim — Riley31415/wuwa_calc inside Wuthering Tools+

`/rankings` hosts Riley's team comparison table and rotation detail pages (his GitHub Pages site)
inside this app's layout. His code is **not copied**: it is the git submodule `vendor/wuwa_calc`,
imported through the Vite alias `@skittle/*` and compiled by Vite straight from his TypeScript.

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `vendor/wuwa_calc` | the submodule (pinned commit); `git -C vendor/wuwa_calc pull` to update, then `node scripts/skittle-sync.mjs` |
| `skittle-modules.d.ts` | `declare module "@skittle/*"` — vue-tsc never type-checks his sources (his tsconfig differs) |
| `skittle.css` | GENERATED: his `resources/index.css` with every selector scoped under `.skittle-root` (`.pop`, `.ctxmenu`, `body.coldrag` stay global because he appends those to `document.body`) |
| `rankings/controller.ts` | port of his `src/index.ts`: builds the DOM his page modules cache at import time (`#app`, `#topbar`, `#backLink`, `#loading`) inside a persistent `.skittle-root`, imports his modules lazily, runs his solve/run passes, routes detail views through vue-router |
| `rankings/solver.worker.ts` | worker entry: importing his `solver.ts` registers `onmessage` |
| `public/tests/solves/*.json` | GENERATED: his precomputed solves; his page fetches `./tests/solves/…` relative to `/rankings` |
| `public/sim/loading.gif` | GENERATED: the overlay sticker |
| `skittle-theme.css` | hand-written theme bridge (phase B2): re-derives his `--bg/--surface/--ink/--accent…` variables from DaisyUI's tokens (`oklch(var(--b1))` etc.) on `.skittle-root`, `.pop` and `.ctxmenu`, sets the app font, and darkens kit colours / hard-coded whites on `[data-theme-style="light"]` — so the page follows every app theme |
| `src/pages/RankingsView.vue` | the page: `<Nav>` + host div + credit line; claims `100vw` so AppLayout's content-sized `.contain` grid (and the update banner) span the viewport |

Things learned the hard way:
- Vue's root is `#wt-app` (index.html / main.ts) so that `#app` is free for his container.
- His `loadSolves()` probes `/__livereload`; any SPA host answers 200 with index.html, which would skip the
  shipped solves and re-solve 625 teams in the browser. The controller answers that one fetch with a 404.
- His `paint()` awaits two `requestAnimationFrame`s; rAF never fires in a background tab or headless
  Electron, so the port races it against an 80 ms timeout.
- His `body`/`html` rules become `.skittle-root { height: 100vh }` after scoping — the page's `!important`
  overrides size it to the host instead.
- AppLayout's `.contain` is a content-sized grid: a page narrower than the viewport shrinks the grid (and the
  update banner) to its own width. The rankings page sets `width: 100vw`.
- Visual checks: `node ~/Projects/wuwa-tools/scripts/shot.mjs http://localhost:5173/rankings --theme light --out x.png`
  (headless-Chromium DevTools screenshot; Cypress's `cy.screenshot()` hangs in this sandbox).
- Cypress smoke spec: `cypress/e2e/rankings.cy.ts`.
- Updating Riley: `~/Projects/wuwa-tools/scripts/sync-skittle.sh [--push]`.
