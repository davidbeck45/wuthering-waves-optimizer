# src/sim — Riley31415/wuwa_calc inside Wuthering Tools+

`/rankings` hosts Riley's team comparison table and rotation detail pages (his GitHub Pages site)
inside this app's layout. His code is **not copied**: it is the git submodule `vendor/wuwa_calc`,
imported through the Vite alias `@skittle/*` and compiled by Vite straight from his TypeScript.

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `vendor/wuwa_calc` | the submodule (pinned commit); `git -C vendor/wuwa_calc pull` to update, then `node scripts/skittle-sync.mjs` |
| `skittle-modules.d.ts` | `declare module "@skittle/*"` — vue-tsc never type-checks his sources (his tsconfig differs) |
| `skittle.css` | GENERATED: his `resources/index.css` with every selector scoped under `.skittle-root` (`.pop`, `.ctxmenu`, `body.coldrag` stay global because he appends those to `document.body`) |
| `rankings/controller.ts` | port of his `src/index.ts`: builds the DOM his page modules cache at import time (`#app`, `#topbar`, `#backLink`, `#loading`) inside a persistent `.skittle-root`, imports his modules lazily, runs his solve/run passes, routes detail views through vue-router |
| `rankings/solver.worker.ts` | worker entry: importing his `solver.ts` registers `onmessage` |
| `public/tests/solves/*.json` | GENERATED: his precomputed solves; his page fetches `./tests/solves/…` relative to `/rankings` |
| `public/sim/loading.gif` | GENERATED: the overlay sticker |
| `skittle-theme.css` | hand-written theme bridge (phase B2): re-derives his `--bg/--surface/--ink/--accent…` variables from DaisyUI's tokens (`oklch(var(--b1))` etc.) on `.skittle-root`, `.pop` and `.ctxmenu`, sets the app font, and darkens kit colours / hard-coded whites on `[data-theme-style="light"]` — so the page follows every app theme |
| `src/pages/RankingsView.vue` | the page: `<Nav>` + host div + credit line; a fixed-height column (`100dvh` on phones) that Riley's `#app` scrolls inside |

Things learned the hard way:
- Vue's root is `#wt-app` (index.html / main.ts) so that `#app` is free for his container.
- His `loadSolves()` probes `/__livereload`; any SPA host answers 200 with index.html, which would skip the
  shipped solves and re-solve 625 teams in the browser. The controller answers that one fetch with a 404.
- His `paint()` awaits two `requestAnimationFrame`s; rAF never fires in a background tab or headless
  Electron, so the port races it against an 80 ms timeout.
- His `body`/`html` rules become `.skittle-root { height: 100vh }` after scoping — the page's `!important`
  overrides size it to the host instead.
- The `#app` → `#wt-app` rename silently dropped upstream's `#app { width: 100% }` (style.css): `body` is a flex
  row, so the Vue root shrank to its content — the rankings page used to claim `100vw` to compensate, and on a
  phone `/settings` and `/my-rankings` grew past the viewport. `style.css` now names `#wt-app` too; nothing
  under it should size itself to the viewport.
- Visual checks: `node ~/Projects/wuwa-tools/scripts/shot.mjs http://localhost:5173/rankings --theme light --out x.png`
  (headless-Chromium DevTools screenshot; Cypress's `cy.screenshot()` hangs in this sandbox).
- Cypress smoke spec: `cypress/e2e/rankings.cy.ts` (CI shard `plus` = every root-level `cypress/e2e/*.cy.ts`).
  CI must check out submodules (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`): without `vendor/wuwa_calc` the lazy `/rankings`
  chunk fails to resolve `@skittle/*`, the page (and its Nav) never mounts, and the spec times out.
- Updating Riley: `~/Projects/wuwa-tools/scripts/sync-skittle.sh [--push]`. Sept 2026 (his "huge update" / "substat
  updates"): `index.css` and `loading.gif` moved to his repo root (`skittle-sync.mjs` looks there first), `teamWanted(key,
  members)` takes the team key, his error page is gone (errors go into the overlay's `.loading-error` box — the controller's
  `showBootError`), and a first-visit `tutorial.ts` exists that the port deliberately never shows. His substat pieces are now
  ER-tiered `ErSpread`s (`Loadout.spread(highSubs, erRolls, mySubs)`); the fork's `plus` keeps `mySubstat` as a fixed third
  piece the ER climb skips (`teamrun.ts` guard), rebased on top.

## Phones (2026-09-15)

Upstream's layout is already responsive (768 px breakpoint, hamburger sub-navs); the plus additions are what
broke on a phone. Rules and pieces:

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/style.css` `#app, #wt-app { width: 100% }` | the root-width fix above — the one change that touched every page |
| `Nav.vue` below `sm` (640 px) | five icon links + hamburger + theme + `…` never fit DaisyUI's 50 %/50 % navbar halves: `navbar-start` becomes `flex-1`, `navbar-end` content-sized, icons 40 px with a 4 px gap, the `…` summary `px-2`. Fits 360 px with a desktop scrollbar (Cypress) — the gate in `phoneLayout.cy.ts` measures the Rankings icon against the theme button |
| `phone-tables.css` (`table--cards`) | a DaisyUI `table` that reflows into flex cards below 768 px: `thead` hidden, each `tr` a wrapping flex card, `td[data-label]` captions itself; the component picks the card order with `.cell--*` classes. Used by `MyRankingsView.vue` (rank · name · damage on the first line, weapon / rotation / bar / deltas / buttons below; the what-if row stays a full-width panel) and `PhoneEchoBatchParser.vue` (screenshot + cost first, the echo / set / main / substat selects below). Same markup as the desktop table, so the E2E hooks and colspan rows are unchanged |
| `Settings.vue` / `SettingsView.vue` (upstream files, two-line diffs) | the classic tab strip wraps below `sm`, page padding 1 rem — upstream's own page grows to 545 px on a phone once the root is 100 % (PR candidate, parked) |
| `RankingsView.vue` | `100dvh` height so the credit line and the bottom of Riley's table clear Android's URL bar; credit shortened below `sm`. The B2b bottom sheet (above) is unchanged |
| `index.html` + `public/manifest.webmanifest` + `public/icons/` | `theme-color`, standalone manifest and 192/512/apple-touch icons (rendered from `icons/icon.svg` with `rsvg-convert`) so the site installs to an Android/iOS home screen; `viewport-fit=cover` |
| **`src/sim/phone.css`** (global, imported in `main.ts`; second pass, 2026-09-15 from David's phone screenshots) | phone-only overrides keyed by upstream's own class names, so Ryan's `.vue` files stay untouched: the `.calculator__damages` / `.calculator-optimizer__damages` attack tables become two-line cards (name, then Normal · Average · Crit with `::before` captions from `nth-child`); the classic echo cards (`CalculatorEcho.vue`, `CalculatorEchoCard.vue`) reflow below `lg` into picture-beside-name + full-width stat table + one row of actions (CSS grid over `display: contents`, no markup change); DaisyUI `.collapse` tracks `minmax(0, 1fr)` so long titles wrap; `AppRichSelect` min-width capped at its container (upstream's own 480 px override never applied — the component sets the variable on itself); the pick-one browsers (characters / weapons / main echoes) two per row; modals as full-width bottom sheets; optimizer results stacked (stat tables) with loadout tiles two per row; team list / editor rows wrap; v3 strips wrap; the navbar pinned to 80 px and `.contain`'s `mt-20` set in px — at a phone's 130 % font size the rem margin opened a 24 px band under the bar |

**The budget is 360–412 px at a 130 % font size.** David's S26 Ultra renders type ~30 % larger (Samsung's font-size
setting); the four screenshots he sent (optimizer result stats, a rotation damage table, the character browser, an
inventory echo card) all fit at 100 % and broke at 130 %. `shot.mjs --font-scale 1.3` emulates it (`html { font-size:
130% }`, which is what Android's text scaling does to rem-based layout); a rule that only holds at 100 % is not done.

Gates: `cypress/e2e/phoneLayout.cy.ts` at 360 × 800 — every route inside the viewport width, the nav clear of the
utility menu, the two card tables reflowed (and back to tables at 1440), the calculator's damage tables and echo cards
reflowed with the character browser at two per row, real OCR review inside the importer; `themes.cy.ts` for the
Gruvbox dark theme (`tailwind.config.js` `gruvbox`, listed in `useTheme.ts`; morhetz's medium palette — orange / blue
/ aqua as primary / secondary / accent, bg0 page, bg0_s / bg1 cards and nav).
Visual checks: `shot.mjs … --width 384 --height 854 --mobile` (touch + DPR 3), `--files "<selector>=a.jpg,b.jpg"`
for the importer, `--eval-file` with an overflow probe (the session scratchpad has one: innermost visible elements
whose right edge passes `clientWidth`).

Known, left alone: Riley's slot columns still scroll horizontally inside `.tcwrap` on a phone (his DOM, B2b's
native table is the fix); the account bar takes three rows on a phone; the inventory at 250 echoes is one long
column of cards (a two-column tile grid would need the compact card, which upstream only ships under the v3 flag).


## Stock presets from wuwa_calc (phase C) — `src/sim/presets/`

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | loaders: `loadWuwaCalcRotationPresets(key)` (one lazy JSON chunk per character via `import.meta.glob`; appended to the curated list by `CalculatorRotations.vue` for the Rotation presets modal and by `TeamRotationTeamEditor.vue` for the team-slot import dialog — the calculator engine and `getCharByName` never touch them), `loadWuwaCalcTeamPresets()` (lazy `data/teams.json`, joined to the curated list the first time Teams > List Presets opens) |
| `data/rotations/<Key>.json` | GENERATED — `CharacterRotationPreset[]` per character: the top steady-state loops Riley's engine ran for that resonator in each solver state (see below), team-dependent variants included (e.g. Xuanling's 3 vs 5 "Still as Withered Wood" shadows), mapped onto this app's attack keys; identical action lists across states are emitted once |
| `data/teams.json` | GENERATED — `TeamRotationPreset[]`: per solver state, for every main DPS the app knows, the best 3 distinct compositions, the three rotations interleaved in execution order, main DPS in slot 0, enemy = level 100 / 20% RES (Riley's target) |
| `data/manifest.json` | GENERATED — provenance (`wuwaCalcCommit`, `appCommit`, state, timestamp) and counts |
| `data/breakpoints.json` | GENERATED — the **sequence-breakpoints table** (`wuwa-tools/rotation-port/export_breakpoints.mjs`, kept with its prose twin in `wuwa-tools/knowledge/`): per resonator, each of Riley's loadouts with the sequence levels at which its declared loop switches (`Loadout.rotationAt` over the kit's `rotation: { 0: …, 3: … }` map) and what the switch adds/drops, plus the Sequence pieces with his own note on each. `loadSequenceBreakpoints(key)` (keyed by Riley's name, so both Rover forms match) feeds the Rotation presets modal's "Sequence breakpoints" block (`CalculatorRotationsPresetsModal.vue`, `describeBreakpoints()`). Each switch carries a `kind`: `loop` (different casts), `order` (same casts reordered) or `chain` (only an opener / first-visit / start-of-combat chain differs — Aemeath S1, Xuanling S1, Hiyuki S2, Phrolova S2); two identical Rotation objects (Jiyan's S6) are no breakpoint. 12 of 47 resonators have one, 8 of them a real loop change (2026-09-15). The import/sync hint `nextLoopChange` fires only for a real loop change |
| `wuwaCalcPresets.test.ts` | gate: every generated action resolves on its character through `resolveRotationActionToAttackData`, names unique and disjoint from the curated presets, every team a complete 3-slot team |

Generator: `~/Projects/wuwa-tools/rotation-port/emit_app_presets.py --states s6r5,s6r5mdps,s6r1mdps` (after
`export_rotations.mjs <state>` → `dump_app_tables.ts` → `map_rotations.py --state <state>` per state, see that README).
**Negative-status ticks are actions (2026-09-14):** a tick Riley's engine fires ("Aero Erosion - 9 Stacks", "Fusion Burst -
10 Stacks", "Glacio Chafe - 13 Stacks", Electro Flare, Spectro Frazzle) becomes the app's own per-tick negative-status
action (`type: "negativeStatus"`, key `ElementalEffect<Status>`, `negativeStatusStacks` = the tick's count, capped at the
stack tables' 13 / Aero Erosion 12; an Electro Flare tick also carries the Electro Rage held) — Hiyuki's converted ticks
use her own `ElementalEffectGlacioBite` forte row. Every team preset's `enemyConfig` carries the **enemy settings the run
held**: each tick status at its ceiling in the loop, Electro Rage, and Havoc Bane / Tune Strain at the count in force on
most damage casts (`enemyConfigOf` here, `enemy_config_of` in the Python mapper; 76 of 130 team presets set one).
Solver states shipped: **S6R5** (everyone S6, R5 signatures), **S6R5 DPS · S0R1 team** and **S6R1 DPS · S0R1 team**
(only the main DPS S6, everyone else S0 with R1 weapons — the realistic case when supports aren't S6/R5); names
carry the state tag, and each character preset's name states that character's own sequence and weapon. Never hand-edit `data/`. Casts the app has no action for are listed in each
preset's description as "Not ported" (as of 2026-09-11: the echoes Oblivion / Core of Collapse / Hecate, Cantarella's
"Beneath the Sea", one forte heavy). Kit multipliers Riley folds into his motion values (Hiyuki, Cantarella, Brant,
Galbrena, …) are mapped by ratio — the app applies them through the kit's buffs, so keep those enabled.

## Endstate Matrix planner (track F) — pulled out 2026-09-14

`/matrix` (phase data, roster + ticked extras, Riley's engine scoring every composition in a worker pool, the
Vigor-aware plan, saved plans) lived in `src/sim/matrix/` with `cypress/e2e/matrix.cy.ts` and a nav button. David
had it removed from the app for now (feature work first; the worker pool is a performance worry); the offline twin
`wuwa-tools/matrix-plan/` stays. To bring it back, revert the commit that deleted the folder (`git log --diff-filter=D
-- src/sim/matrix`), re-add the route in `main.ts` and the nav button, and re-point `myBuilds.ts` at
`planMatrix.ts` if the name map ever moves again (`rileyNameOf` now lives in `rankings/castMapper.ts`). Saved plans
in browsers stay under localStorage `wuthering-tools-plus.matrix.*`.

## Phone-screenshot echo import (phase D) — `src/sim/echoScan/`

Batch import of echoes from phone screenshots of the in-game Echo inventory (an echo selected, its detail
panel on the right; one screenshot per echo). Lives in the Inventory › **Import echoes** modal under the PC
parser as "Phone screenshots (batch)"; emits the same `echoes-parsed` event as `CalculatorEchoParser`, so
`CalculatorEchoImporter`'s duplicate review + save flow is reused unchanged.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `phoneEchoScan.ts` | pure logic, **geometry first** (2026-09-12): `PHONE_LAYOUTS` (crop boxes + the stat table's geometry measured on a Galaxy S26 Ultra, 3120×1440; same-aspect sizes are scaled), `clusterRows` (the block pass's word boxes → rows: label words left, value column right), `labelKey` (whitespace/punctuation-insensitive stat aliases), `valueCandidates` / `legalValues` / `pickLegal` (a value is accepted only as a legal roll for its label — `subStatsTable`, `statsTable`, the fixed secondary row; "108%" is repaired to 10.8), `scanEcho` (walks the table from the known first-row position: observed rows are re-read from the raw pixels of their own row through a `BoxReader`, a row the block pass dropped is synthesized at its expected position — rows are 60 px apart, +46 after a wrapped label — and read the same way; stops at "Echo Skill"; everything doubtful lands in `flags`), `bestEcho` (drops the "Phantom:" skin prefix, scores every word-prefix of the name strip and the panel's first row, the COST breaks ties) / `bestSet`, `toParsedEcho` (the importer's shape with verbose labels). Twin of `wuwa-tools/echo-import/extract.py`, which reads the 198-shot "Wuwa Echos" album 198/198 |
| `ocr.ts` | tesseract.js worker wrapper: crop → scale → threshold / invert / plain grey / untouched colour → recognise; `recognizeWords` returns word boxes (the block pass), per-call whitelists (digits only for value re-reads) |
| `imageMatch.ts` | promise wrapper over the app's `echoParser.worker` (portrait + set-glyph pixel matching), used only as fallback when the name or the set isn't readable |
| `PhoneEchoBatchParser.vue` | the UI: multi-file input, sequential scan with progress, editable results table (echo / set / main / substats), flags per row, "Add N echoes to inventory" |
| `phoneEchoScan.test.ts` + `__fixtures__/s26UltraScanSamples.json` | replay of the word boxes and row re-reads recorded from 75 real screenshots (`wuwa-tools/echo-import/dump_scan_fixture.py`; the Python walk they come from is verified 198/198 by hand-checked records), incl. every shot whose rows had to be synthesized |
| `api/photos-album.ts`, `api/photos-image.ts`, `api/_lib/googlePhotos.ts` (+ `src/server/googlePhotos.test.ts`) | **album import (2026-09-12)**: Vercel functions (served by a Vite middleware in dev, see `vite.config.ts`) that fetch a shared Google Photos album's page and its photos same-origin — the browser cannot read either directly (HTML from another origin; no CORS header on Google's image host). Only `photos.app.goo.gl` / `photos.google.com` links and lh3 `/pw/` ids are accepted. The panel remembers per album (localStorage `wuthering-tools-plus.echoScan.albums`) which photos were added, so a later run fetches and scans only the tail; "Mark all as imported" seeds that for an album whose echoes are already in |
| `cypress/e2e/echoScanAlbum.cy.ts` | the album flow with the API stubbed (real OCR on the fixture photo): load → "1 new" → fetch & scan → add → reload shows "1 already imported · 0 new"; plus the error path |
| `skittle-theme.css` + `controller.ts` — phones (2026-09-12, B2b first cut) | below 768 px Riley's aside (README, standards, team cost, resonator search) becomes a bottom sheet behind a "Filters & options" toolbar button (backdrop / ✕ / Escape close it; the detail page hides the toolbar); desktop unchanged. E2E: `rankings.cy.ts` at 390 × 844. Still his DOM: native Vue table + detail remain the rest of B2b |
| `castMapper.ts` (2026-09-12) | every wuwa_calc cast now maps (was 10 unmatched): casts named after an echo's passive alias to their echo (Core of Collapse → Threnodian Leviathan), a resonator's own cast that wuwa_calc types as an Echo cast falls through to the kit's rows (Lucilla's Forte Echo - Oblivion), an echo with a single damage row matches per-hit without a name resemblance (Hecate = 6 × Crescent Servants — the registry's rank-5 value was corrected to the 45.59 % its own text states), and hand overrides carry kit-folded multipliers into the preset description (Cantarella's Beneath the Sea = Flowing Suffocation × 4.7 from S3; Qingxiao's Heaven's Reckoning × 2.75). Fixture `__fixtures__/wuwaCalcLoops.json` = 43 loops of 16 resonators, regenerated by `wuwa-tools/rotation-port/emit_ts_fixture.py` |
| `cypress/e2e/echoScanBatch.cy.ts` + `cypress/fixtures/echoScan/*.jpg` | real OCR end-to-end on three screenshots — two of one echo plus a Sabercat Prowler whose "8.6%" row block-only OCR used to lose (tesseract language data comes from its CDN, reference portraits from the assets CDN) |

Reading order per screenshot: name (PSM 7) → panel (PSM 6, two passes: binarised ×1.5 and greyscale ×2, rows only
the second pass saw are added and flagged) → Sonata chip (PSM 7, inverted) → if the name or set is still unknown,
the worker matches the portrait (cost-filtered) and the glyph next to +25 (among the echo's allowed sets).
Tip for users: turn a Sonata filter on in-game before shooting — the chip then prints the set name.


## Import any rotation from the Rankings page (C4) — `src/sim/rankings/`

Every team the `/rankings` detail page can show — any composition, solver state and pick, including the
compare axes — carries **"Import team into Wuthering Tools+"** in Riley's topbar (next to Back), with a
checkbox to also save each member's steady-state loop to that character's rotations.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `castMapper.ts` | TypeScript port of `wuwa-tools/rotation-port/map_rotations.py`: `appRowsOf(getCharByName(...))` / `echoRowsOf(mainEchoesData)` build the app's attack rows with level-10 motion values; `toActions()` maps executed casts through the cascade override → exact MV → aggregate → per-hit → kit ratio → tick → name-only, with `knownRatios()` pooling a kit's folded multipliers; a negative-status tick becomes a `negativeStatus` action at the tick's stack count; Tune Breaks, 0-MV utility casts and cancelled echo forms are skipped and reported. `enemyStacksOf(heldEnemy)` reads the debuff stacks a traced hit ran under and `enemyConfigOf(casts)` the team enemy settings a loop held (both mirrored in Python; the replay fixture checks both) |
| `importFromRankings.ts` | `prepareTeamImport(engine, tracedRun)` — the store-free half: turns a traced run (`runTeam(..., true)`, `hitsOf(line)` casts named through `CAST_NAME` / `NODE_NAME`) into plain data: the last section (the steady-state loop) mapped per member and interleaved in execution order with the main DPS in slot 0, the enemy settings the run held (`enemyConfigOf` over Riley's level 100 / 20 % RES target), each member's own loop, and per member `loopChangesAt` / `nextLoopChange` (`Loadout.rotationAt`). `importTeamFromRankings(mods, rowKey, { characterRotations, replaceTeamId })` is the browser path: resolves the run from the page model, prepares it, writes the stores (the Pinia stores load lazily inside it — a static import would drag lodash into the CLI). `reslotActions` / `toImportedActions` / `toCharacterRotation` are shared with the headless path |
| `syncTeamsHeadless.ts` | **Node-only** (`npm run cli -- sync-teams`): loads the fork's engine from `vendor/wuwa_calc/src` through a `file:` URL (tsx resolves Riley's `.js` imports to `.ts`; vue-tsc never sees his tree), registers the export's Account State, solves every saved wuwa_calc team's composition at `mine`, runs the best row traced and feeds `prepareTeamImport`; returns the new teams (and characters) for `writeSyncedExport` |
| `controller.ts` | `mountImportControls(key)` after every `renderDetail`; `runImport()` → toast with the outcome (`data-test-rankings-import-done` carries the new team id for tests) |
| `castMapper.test.ts` + `__fixtures__/wuwaCalcLoops.json` | the port must reproduce the Python mapper on 33 of Riley's loops (930 casts, 12 resonators incl. ratio-, tick-, per-hit- and override-heavy kits) |

The generated stock presets (`src/sim/presets/`) remain the zero-click path for the best teams; this is the
everything-else path.



**Mapping fix 2026-09-14 (David: "the big attack is counted twice"):** `castMapper.ts` and the Python mapper
matched casts on Riley's *run* motion value (`h.mv`, after MulMv effects such as Aemeath's S3 "Finale multiplier
+100%" or S2 "Duet multiplier +100%"), so an integer multiplier read as extra hits — Finale ×2, the Duets ×2, and
17 characters' stock loops likewise (Camellya's Vining Waltz ×17, Phrolova's Scarlet Coda ×7, Cartethyia's
Liberation ×2 …). `Cast.mv` is now the kit's own `action.mv` (the app applies those multipliers through its own
chains and buffs; `mvRun` keeps the run's value for the record), a kit cast named after a status ("Forte - Seraphic
Duet: Tune Rupture") is no longer dropped as an enemy tick, and Aemeath's Mech chain has overrides for its MV ties.
On David's Mornye · Lynae · Aemeath import the app went 13.66M → 9.85M against Riley's 8.20M (the rest is engine
modelling: static buffs, no status stacks written yet — Phase 2). Regenerate after such a change: the three
`export_rotations.mjs` states → `map_rotations.py` → `emit_app_presets.py` → `emit_ts_fixture.py` (the replay test
compares TS to Python on the same loops, so both mappers move together).

**Audit fixes (2026-09-15, seven agents over the imports on David's export — vault Session Log):** the team paths map
one hit at a time, so a row that stands for N ticks was written once *per tick* (Cantarella's Diffusion ×31, Ciaccona's
Tonic ×30) — `toActions` now takes a shared `TickState` per member and `finishTicks` settles it after the loop.
Aemeath's "Forte - Seraphic Duet: Fusion Burst" (a 0-MV cast: the status at the cap rung × Fusion Trail / Stardust /
S2) was dropped — it is now her `ElementalEffectFusionBurst` at the loop's cap (`fusionBurstCapOf`: 10, or 13 beside
Denia) with the run's multiplier as an action-level `talentModifierMultiply` and her two multiplier buffs switched off
per action (`advancedConfig`), on the status's own tick too. An Electro Flare tick's Rage count is read off the
"Electro Rage - N" tick that follows (`attachRage`; Riley revokes Rage in the hook that fires the Flare). Cascade:
the aggregate rule is name-gated (sim ≥ 0.6), per-hit candidates are ranked (Rebecca's enhanced rows, Buling's two
Talismans), the ratio rule never takes a healing/shield row, and a cast the app splits in two rows (Lioness of Glory
Blast + Crash, Feilian Attack + Whirlwind) presses both (`sum2`); overrides for Jingran's swapped hold MVs and
Danjin's Crimson Erosion typo. Every import also records **`handoffs`** (who each member's Outro hands off to: the
first cast another member *presses* after it, `handoffsOf`) on the team — the team-buff derivation reads it (below).
TS and Python agree on all 1,247 loops of the three states (audit harness), 68 sim tests.

**Sync my teams (Track I phase 2, 2026-09-14):** the bar's **Sync my teams** button re-imports every saved team
whose name marks it as wuwa_calc's (`isGeneratedTeamName`: an import "wuwa_calc …" or a stock preset
"… (wuwa_calc tNNN)") at the account's own state and updates it **in place** — `syncTeams.ts` (`runSync(deps)`:
`rileyTeamKeysFor` finds every loadout variant of the composition, `deps.solveBest` solves them at `mine` and the
best-scoring one wins, `deps.importInto` re-imports it; `diffActions` reports per slot/attack/main-echo/stack-count
moves and `diffEnemy` the enemy-settings fields that moved; a team is "updated" when either did), `controller.ts`
`syncMyTeams()` (the browser deps: `ensureBestPicks` + `bestPicks` with `filters.cost` switched to `mine` only
while solving and importing, restored after — the table on screen is untouched), `importFromRankings.ts`
`replaceTeamId` (actions re-slotted to the saved team's own slot order, enemy = Riley's target **plus the stacks the
run held**, the name follows the new state only while it still reads as generated; a row the table solved but never
ran is run traced on the spot). The report lists per team the moved actions (a tick as "Aero Erosion @9 0→13"), the
enemy settings that moved, and **which member's next sequence switches their loop** ("Denia S0 → S3"). Teams the
player named are left alone and listed as such. On David's export (2026-09-14 evening): 33 teams → 30 updated,
1 unchanged, 2 left alone; 17 teams got enemy settings, 8 carry a loop-change hint.

**Headless:** `npm run cli -- sync-teams [--out file] [--dry-run] [--subs standard|high|mine] [--rotations]`
(`syncTeamsHeadless.ts` + `writeSyncedExport` in `cli/exportFile.ts`) does the same from the terminal in ~3 s and
writes a new export next to the source (`<name>_synced.json`; a plain export is never overwritten, a `_synced` file
syncs over itself through a temp file, so the bare command keeps working once the synced copy is the newest
download; `--rotations` replaces a member loop already saved under the same name instead of appending it again) —
Settings › Import replaces the whole app database with it. `wuwa-tools/rotation-port/sync_teams.mjs` is the front
door: it runs the command and prints, per team, Riley's DPR beside the app's own engine before and after
(`cli -- team` on both files).
## "My build" in the Substat Investment compare — `src/sim/rankings/myBuilds.ts`

Riley's Substats compare offers two spreads per resonator: his default (ChemX32) and High Invest. The
plus site adds a third row, **My build**: the substat rolls on the five echoes that character has
equipped in this app's calculator, run through his engine like any other pick.

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `myBuilds.ts` | pure: `buildRollsOf(characters, inventoryEchoes)` resolves each character's `echoes[slot].echoId` against the inventory (`resolveCharacterEchoes`) and turns the five echoes' substats into `{ kind, value }` rolls in his `Substat` names (Healing Bonus has no counterpart and is skipped); `rollsKey()` tells one build from the next |
| `controller.ts` | `mountRankings(host, router, builds)` / `updateMyBuilds(builds)`: registers every build on the page's loadouts (`setMySubstat` + `customSubstats("My build", rolls)`) and posts `{ type: "mySubstats" }` to every solver worker — the worker is what builds the rows, so it has to know too |
| `solver.worker.ts` | intercepts that message ahead of Riley's `onmessage` |
| `RankingsView.vue` | computes the builds from the character + inventory stores and re-registers on change |
| fork `davidbeck45/wuwa_calc` branch `plus` | the engine side: `Loadout.mySubstat/mySubstatKey`, `customSubstats()`, `setMySubstat()`, a third entry in `buildsOf` when the axis is open, `.uKEY` in combo keys, "My build" labels, and the table grouping / twin / baseline rules for the new pick (`page/table.ts`, `rowFromKey` in `page/model.ts`) |

Only resonators with a build in the app get the row (`#r=Cartethyia&cb=Cartethyia` after an import
shows it; Mornye without one does not). The row keys carry the build's hash, so a changed build gets fresh
solves, and a `#team=` link to a stale one falls back to the table. E2E: `cypress/e2e/rankings.cy.ts`.

## My roster rankings (phase E) — `src/sim/myRankings/`

`/my-rankings` (linked from the credit line on `/rankings`, and back): the app's own damage engine ranks the
characters and teams YOU have set up — real weapon, echoes, chains and buffs — the way Riley's table ranks his
solved picks.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `rankRoster.ts` | pure/async `rankRoster(characters, echoes, teams, { investment, onProgress })`: for every character with a weapon (`isSetUp`) it scores every saved rotation, curated preset and wuwa_calc preset with `calcCharacterRotationDamage` on the active build and keeps the best; `investment` re-scores the best rotation with the next sequence node's chains on (first entry of a node when it has variants — an estimate) and with the weapon at R5; teams = your teams with actions + wuwa_calc / curated team presets whose three members are set up, through `calcTeamRotationDamage`. Enemy fixed at level 100 / 20 % RES (`RANKING_ENEMY`, Riley's target) so the numbers sit beside `/rankings` |
| `MyRankingsView.vue` | the page: auto-computes on first visit (cached in module state, recomputed when the stores change), progress bar, two tables with bars, next-S / R5 deltas, empty state, wuwa_calc ⇄ My roster switch |
| `rankRoster.test.ts` + `__fixtures__/cartethyiaAccount.json` | a real exported account (the Cartethyia optimizer fixture) ranks her own, curated and wuwa_calc rotations on her build; unknown ids and weaponless characters are skipped |
| `cypress/e2e/myRankings.cy.ts` | empty state + links, then an imported account ranked in-page |

Metric: average damage per rotation (DPR). DPS appears only when a rotation carries a duration.


## Account State and the "My account" tier — `src/sim/account/` + `/rankings` (Track I, 2026-09-14)

The account-first spine: `accountState.ts` derives one snapshot of the player's account from the
stores (or the export file, on the CLI) — per character `owned` (= a weapon equipped, the bar
my-rankings and Riley's loadouts set), `sequence` (the highest enabled `SequenceNode<N>`, never the
toggle count: a node's sub-toggles once printed Aemeath at "S10"), `weapon` + `refinement`, the active
build, plus teams (`fieldable` = every member set up) and totals. `rileyAccountEntries()` turns it
into what the engine takes; `accountKeyOf()` fingerprints it so a changed account never reads a
stale solve; `rankingsMineHash()` writes the `/rankings` link at the account's own state.

**The `mine` Team Cost** lives on the wuwa_calc fork's `plus` branch (`vendor/wuwa_calc`, beside the
"My build" row): `TEAM_COSTS` gained `"mine"`, `setAccountState(entries, key)` registers the account,
and under `mine` the cost rules read it per member — `costGrant` returns the account's sequence and
weapon rank, `weaponOptions` pins the worn weapon where the loadout lists it (`accountWeapon`; no
weapon set or a resonator the account lacks reads as `s0r1`, a worn weapon the loadout never lists
runs the best standard — `weaponApproximated` says so; **a 4-star or Rover form (`Tier.Free`) counts
as owned even when the account never set it up** — Riley runs them S6 on standard/4-star weapons
throughout, so `accountOf()` synthesises S6 / default weapon at R1 for them, and a set-up one runs
the account's weapon; David's Shorekeeper · Sanhua · Camellya was hidden until this rule, Sanhua
not being in his app data), and `costTag()` suffixes row keys and
shipped-solve signatures with the account key. `precompute.ts` never ships it; the page solves it in
its workers (31 fieldable intended teams in well under a minute on David's export; the same solve is
1.3 s in Node, see `wuwa-tools/rotation-port/solve_mine.mjs`). `page/model.ts` adds `ownedOnly`
(hash `own=0` lifts it): under `mine`, `teamWanted()` drops teams with a resonator the account
lacks, so fewer teams are solved and the table reads as "teams I can field". Riley's Team Cost box
lists "My account" only while an account is registered (`hasAccountState()`).

**App side:** `RankingsView.vue` computes the Account State from the stores and hands it to
`mountRankings(host, router, builds, { entries, key })` / `updateAccountState()` (controller.ts),
which register it on the page and post `{ type: "accountState" }` to every solver worker
(`solver.worker.ts`). `RankingsAccountBar.vue` sits above his page: My account / Riley's tiers (hash
`tc=mine`), the "Teams I can field" box (`own=0`), and **saved views** — named copies of the current
hash in `localStorage["wtplus:rankings:views"]`; every control is a `router.replace` on the hash, so
his page re-reads it through `onLocationChange` like a Back button would. `/my-rankings` shows the
account card and links each character and team row to `/rankings#tc=mine&r=…`.

**One substat spread for every row (David's ask, 2026-09-14 evening):** Riley's Substats compare
opens one resonator's rows side by side (ChemX32 / High Invest / My build). The bar's **Substats**
box instead runs *every* row in one spread — `Filters.subs` (`SUBS_MODES`: `standard` / `high` /
`mine`, hash `sb=h|m`, fork `solver.ts` + `page/model.ts`): a shut Substats box's row takes the
mode's spread in `buildsOf()` (High Invest for everyone; the registered "My build" spread where a
character has echoes in the app and ChemX32 where none), `bestKey()` gains a fourth segment and
`filterSignature()` a suffix on the non-default modes so shipped solves still load for the default
and the rows re-run (never re-search: the best picks come from `picksKey`, which the mode leaves
alone — the same rule as his compare rows). The detail page names the spread per member. On David's
export the top team reads 8.20M (ChemX32) → 9.74M (High Invest) → 9.50M (his own echoes).

Gates: `accountState.test.ts`, the "My account tier" and "one substat spread" describes in
`cypress/e2e/rankings.cy.ts`, `npx tsc -p vendor/wuwa_calc --noEmit` for the engine. CLI:
`npm run cli -- state [--pretty|--riley]` (`--riley` also carries the "My build" rolls, so
`wuwa-tools/rotation-port/solve_mine.mjs --subs high|mine` reproduces the page's three spreads).

## Headless CLI — `src/sim/cli/` (`npm run cli -- <command>`)

The app's own engine from a terminal, for agents and for checking numbers across upstream syncs. The
commands hang off the repo's `ww` program (`cli/index.ts`, two-line hook) and read an **export file** as
their database (`--export <file>`, else `$WUWA_EXPORT`, else the newest `~/Downloads/character_data_*.json`);
nothing is ever written back. Output is JSON when piped, a table on a terminal (`--json` / `--pretty` force).

| Command | What it computes |
|---|---|
| `inspect` | data version, roster (sequence, weapon, builds, rotations), echoes, teams |
| `state` | the Account State (`src/sim/account/`): every character's owned / sequence / weapon / refinement / active build, teams with `fieldable`, totals; `--riley` prints it as wuwa_calc's solver takes it (`{ key, entries }`) |
| `calc <character>` | the calculator page for one character: the 17 stat cards, every attack row (normal / average / crit, healing and shield amounts), each saved rotation with its per-action rows; `--no-attacks`, `--no-rotations`; the name matches loosely (`xuanling`) |
| `team [name\|id\|index]` | `calcTeamRotationDamage` for one team or all of them: totals, per-member, DPS when the team has a duration |
| `rank [--investment]` | `rankRoster` — the `/my-rankings` page headless (best rotation per character, teams, next-S / R5 estimates) |
| `sync-teams [-o file] [--dry-run] [--subs mode] [--rotations]` | "Sync my teams" headless (§ C4): every wuwa_calc team re-imported at the account's own state — actions, per-tick negative-status stacks, enemy settings and handoffs from the run — written to a new export (`<source>_synced.json` by default; a plain export is never overwritten), with the per-team report; `--rotations` also saves each member's loop to that character's rotations (replacing one of the same name) |
| `team <one> --json` | also lists `actionRows`: every action's own normal / average / crit damage in execution order (what the audit compared against Riley's per-cast averages) |
| `snapshot [-o file]` | every character's stats + saved rotations and every team, as JSON (stamps the app commit) |
| `diff <before> <after> [--tolerance pct]` | every number that moved between two snapshots; exit code 2 when something did |

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `engine.ts` | pure wrappers over `buildCharacterCalculationContext` + `calcDamages`, `calcCharacterRotationDamage`, `calcTeamRotationDamage`, `rankRoster`; `STAT_ROWS` = the page's stat cards with their Cypress selectors; snapshot + diff |
| `exportFile.ts` | newest-export discovery and the double-encoded export parse (v1 bare payload through v9) |
| `index.ts` | the Commander commands and printers; engine calls run under `quiet()` because `attacks.ts` still has a stray `console.log` in a hot path (`WUWA_CLI_DEBUG=1` routes it to stderr) |
| `parity.test.ts` | **the gate**: replays every Cypress golden fixture (`cypress/e2e/calculator/data/<Name>/data.ts`, 11 characters) through `calcCharacter` and demands the page's exact formatted stats and attack rows — same semantics as the E2E specs (a class shared by several rows passes when any row carries the numbers) |
| `cli.test.ts` | export parsing, newest-file pick, name resolution, snapshot diff |

`src/sim/presets/index.ts` gained a Node fallback for `import.meta.glob` (reads the generated JSON from disk)
so `rank` works under plain tsx. Regression routine: `~/Projects/wuwa-tools/scripts/sync-plus.sh` snapshots
before the upstream merge and diffs after the gates (`snapshots/<sha>.json` in wuwa-tools); moved numbers
withhold `--push`. Not built: `optimize` (the workers expose nothing but `onmessage`) — only if a need appears.


## Team-aware buffs and builds — `src/sim/teamContext/`

**Three rules added 2026-09-15 (the audit found every one over-buffing a support):** a provider with Resonance Modes
(Aemeath, Denia, Lucilla, Lynae) brings only the mode they are in — a buff bound to another mode by its `stance` or its
key suffix (`…FusionBurst`, `…TuneStrain2`, `…Shifting`) is skipped; a buff worded for "the incoming Resonator" / "the
next character" (41 of 183 definitions, `INCOMING_RE`) is an Outro handoff and reaches only the character who follows
the provider — read off the team's recorded `handoffs` (a wuwa_calc import writes them; the block order of the actions
stands in for a hand-built team, and a team with no actions keeps the old everyone-gets-it rule); a sequence-node buff
is recognised by "Sequence Node N:" or "SN:" in its name (Suisui's "S2: Clouds Pour…" +50 % Crit DMG leaked at S0).
`slots[].skipped` says which rule dropped what. On David's 31 synced teams the median app/Riley ratio went to 0.96.


Upstream computes each team slot from that character's stored build **including the Team Buffs panel
saved on the Calculator page** — two teammates picked there, which need not be the team's real members
(David's Aemeath panel named Mornye + Lynae; every Aemeath team inherited those buffs). `resolveTeam.ts`
rewrites the members for the team they are actually in, before the engine runs:

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Build per slot | explicit pin → a saved build whose name mentions both teammates in any order (`"Moonlit (Lupa + Galbrena)"`, `"Moonlit Chisa (Yangyang Suisui)"`: the key, the roster name, or any 4+-letter word of the key; case and punctuation ignored; only when the character has more than one build) → the active build. Pins are baked into the returned `characters`, so pass the returned `buildIds` (all null) to the engine |
| Panel kept | a member whose own panel already names exactly the team's other members keeps it verbatim (the user curated it) |
| Otherwise derived | from what each teammate's build really provides: outro / inherent / skill team buffs; **sequence-node buffs only when that node is on their build** (key match on their `resonanceChains`, else "Sequence Node N" ≤ their node count); the weapon's team buff only if they hold that weapon (matched by the buff's image basename); 5-piece set buffs only with 5 of that set equipped; main-echo buffs only with that main echo; stacks at `realisticMaxStacks` under the chain-adjusted cap; `inputBase` buffs (Shorekeeper's Energy Regen, Crit-Rate-scaled ones) fed from the teammate's **real** `finalStats` instead of a typed guess |
| Teammate with no build | still a teammate: outro / inherent buffs provided, sequence nodes assumed **S6 for a 4-star, S0 for a 5-star**, nothing gear-based, `realisticBaseAttrValue` for stat-scaled buffs |
| Still yours | per-action advanced overrides and the exclude-team-buffs flags apply on top inside the engine; `auto: false` is a strict passthrough of upstream behaviour |

Switch: `autoTeamBuffs.ts` (`localStorage["wtplus:teamBuffs:auto"]`, default on, **off under Cypress** so
upstream's E2E numbers hold) with `AutoTeamBuffsToggle.vue` in the Team Rotations editor header and on
`/my-rankings`. Hooks: `TeamRotations.vue` (list totals + fingerprint), `TeamRotationTeamEditor.vue`
(`recompute()`, the per-slot snapshot the action editor shows), `rankRoster.ts` (`autoTeamBuffs` option),
CLI `team` / `rank` / `snapshot` (`--no-auto-buffs`; `team <one>` prints each slot's build and buff source,
plus the buffs a teammate does *not* own yet). Still static: the engine has no uptime — a buff is on for the
whole rotation or off; Riley's engine is the one that plays the timeline. Tests: `resolveTeam.test.ts`
(real Augusta / Iuno / Shorekeeper / Sanhua data).
