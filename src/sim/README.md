# src/sim — Riley31415/wuwa_calc inside Wuthering Tools+

`/rankings` hosts Riley's team comparison table and rotation detail pages (his GitHub Pages site)
inside this app's layout. His code is **not copied**: it is the git submodule `vendor/wuwa_calc`,
imported through the Vite alias `@skittle/*` and compiled by Vite straight from his TypeScript.

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `vendor/wuwa_calc` | the submodule (pinned commit); `git -C vendor/wuwa_calc pull` to update, then `node scripts/skittle-sync.mjs` |
| `skittle-modules.d.ts` | `declare module "@skittle/*"` — vue-tsc never type-checks his sources (his tsconfig differs) |
| `skittle.css` | GENERATED: his `resources/index.css` with every selector scoped under `.skittle-root` (`.pop`, `.ctxmenu`, `body.coldrag` stay global because he appends those to `document.body`) |
| `rankings/controller.ts` | port of his `src/index.ts`: builds the DOM his page modules cache at import time (`#app`, `#topbar`, `#backLink`, `#loading`) inside a persistent `.skittle-root`, imports his modules lazily, runs his solve/run passes, routes detail views through vue-router |
| `rankings/solver.worker.ts` | worker entry: importing his `solver.ts` registers `onmessage` |
| `public/tests/solves/*.json` | GENERATED: his precomputed solves; his page fetches `./tests/solves/…` relative to `/rankings` |
| `public/sim/loading.gif` | GENERATED: the overlay sticker |
| `skittle-theme.css` | hand-written theme bridge (phase B2): re-derives his `--bg/--surface/--ink/--accent…` variables from DaisyUI's tokens (`oklch(var(--b1))` etc.) on `.skittle-root`, `.pop` and `.ctxmenu`, sets the app font, and darkens kit colours / hard-coded whites on `[data-theme-style="light"]` — so the page follows every app theme |
| `src/pages/RankingsView.vue` | the page: `<Nav>` + host div + credit line; claims `100vw` so AppLayout's content-sized `.contain` grid (and the update banner) span the viewport |

Things learned the hard way:
- Vue's root is `#wt-app` (index.html / main.ts) so that `#app` is free for his container.
- His `loadSolves()` probes `/__livereload`; any SPA host answers 200 with index.html, which would skip the
  shipped solves and re-solve 625 teams in the browser. The controller answers that one fetch with a 404.
- His `paint()` awaits two `requestAnimationFrame`s; rAF never fires in a background tab or headless
  Electron, so the port races it against an 80 ms timeout.
- His `body`/`html` rules become `.skittle-root { height: 100vh }` after scoping — the page's `!important`
  overrides size it to the host instead.
- AppLayout's `.contain` is a content-sized grid: a page narrower than the viewport shrinks the grid (and the
  update banner) to its own width. The rankings page sets `width: 100vw`.
- Visual checks: `node ~/Projects/wuwa-tools/scripts/shot.mjs http://localhost:5173/rankings --theme light --out x.png`
  (headless-Chromium DevTools screenshot; Cypress's `cy.screenshot()` hangs in this sandbox).
- Cypress smoke spec: `cypress/e2e/rankings.cy.ts` (CI shard `plus` = every root-level `cypress/e2e/*.cy.ts`).
  CI must check out submodules (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`): without `vendor/wuwa_calc` the lazy `/rankings`
  chunk fails to resolve `@skittle/*`, the page (and its Nav) never mounts, and the spec times out.
- Updating Riley: `~/Projects/wuwa-tools/scripts/sync-skittle.sh [--push]`.

## Stock presets from wuwa_calc (phase C) — `src/sim/presets/`

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.ts` | loaders: `loadWuwaCalcRotationPresets(key)` (one lazy JSON chunk per character via `import.meta.glob`; appended to the curated list by `CalculatorRotations.vue` for the Rotation presets modal and by `TeamRotationTeamEditor.vue` for the team-slot import dialog — the calculator engine and `getCharByName` never touch them), `loadWuwaCalcTeamPresets()` (lazy `data/teams.json`, joined to the curated list the first time Teams > List Presets opens) |
| `data/rotations/<Key>.json` | GENERATED — `CharacterRotationPreset[]` per character: the top steady-state loops Riley's engine ran for that resonator in each solver state (see below), team-dependent variants included (e.g. Xuanling's 3 vs 5 "Still as Withered Wood" shadows), mapped onto this app's attack keys; identical action lists across states are emitted once |
| `data/teams.json` | GENERATED — `TeamRotationPreset[]`: per solver state, for every main DPS the app knows, the best 3 distinct compositions, the three rotations interleaved in execution order, main DPS in slot 0, enemy = level 100 / 20% RES (Riley's target) |
| `data/manifest.json` | GENERATED — provenance (`wuwaCalcCommit`, `appCommit`, state, timestamp) and counts |
| `wuwaCalcPresets.test.ts` | gate: every generated action resolves on its character through `resolveRotationActionToAttackData`, names unique and disjoint from the curated presets, every team a complete 3-slot team |

Generator: `~/Projects/wuwa-tools/rotation-port/emit_app_presets.py --states s6r5,s6r5mdps,s6r1mdps` (after
`export_rotations.mjs <state>` → `dump_app_tables.ts` → `map_rotations.py --state <state>` per state, see that README).
Solver states shipped: **S6R5** (everyone S6, R5 signatures), **S6R5 DPS · S0R1 team** and **S6R1 DPS · S0R1 team**
(only the main DPS S6, everyone else S0 with R1 weapons — the realistic case when supports aren't S6/R5); names
carry the state tag, and each character preset's name states that character's own sequence and weapon. Never hand-edit `data/`. Casts the app has no action for are listed in each
preset's description as "Not ported" (as of 2026-09-11: the echoes Oblivion / Core of Collapse / Hecate, Cantarella's
"Beneath the Sea", one forte heavy). Kit multipliers Riley folds into his motion values (Hiyuki, Cantarella, Brant,
Galbrena, …) are mapped by ratio — the app applies them through the kit's buffs, so keep those enabled.
E2E: `cypress/e2e/wuwaCalcPresets.cy.ts`. Credit: author field `Riley31415 (wuwa_calc)` on every preset.


## Endstate Matrix planner (track F) — `src/sim/matrix/`

`/matrix` plans the endgame mode's teams for the account in the app: teams of three plus a Power Circuit fight the
phase's bosses in succession, score is damage dealt (later rounds multiply it), every Resonator fights once (the
designated healers twice) and each boss resists its own element. Rules and the current phase: the vault note
"WuWa Endstate Matrix" and `data/phase.json` (update per phase: bosses + resists, circuits, emergency agent).

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `data/phase.json` | 3.6 S2 Phase 2: rounds, Vigor rules, bosses (element resisted, mechanics, Round 2+ effects), the four circuits |
| `planMatrix.ts` | pure decisions: the roster off the character store (+ ticked extras), compositions (a DPS at the sequence floor with two owned others — one Rover form, at most one other DPS as a support), the solve state per DPS (sequence / weapon rank, R1–R5 interpolated), the Matrix-Mode buff, a Power Circuit from the loop's damage-type mix (with uptime factors for the conditional circuits), the DP that fields the most teams above a floor under Vigor then the highest total (pinned teams kept), round labels, Vigor left |
| `matrix.worker.ts` | Riley's solver + team run on any three loadouts (every loadout variant and slot order — the first slot leads the fight and needs a no-intro chain); answers `catalog` (who has a kit, DPS/support roles, element) and `score` messages |
| `MatrixPlannerView.vue` | the page: phase panels, roster with "use" ticks and extras search, scoring on a worker pool with progress, plan cards weakest → strongest (circuit, bosses to avoid, picks, swap / pin / drop), Vigor left and unfielded reasons, saved plans + JSON copy/import (localStorage `wuthering-tools-plus.matrix.*`) |
| `planMatrix.test.ts` + `__fixtures__/engineScores.json` | the decisions replayed on 11 engine scores recorded from real compositions (`wuwa-tools/matrix-plan`, whose Python planner is the offline twin) |
| `cypress/e2e/matrix.cy.ts` | the Cartethyia fixture + ticked Aero Rover and Sanhua scored by the real engine in workers, a plan, a saved plan surviving a reload |

Scores are Riley's engine on his standard builds for the state (main DPS invested, supports S0R1), not the user's
own echoes; kits wuwa_calc lacks (Zani, 2026-09) show as "no kit — place by hand".

## Phone-screenshot echo import (phase D) — `src/sim/echoScan/`

Batch import of echoes from phone screenshots of the in-game Echo inventory (an echo selected, its detail
panel on the right; one screenshot per echo). Lives in the Inventory › **Import echoes** modal under the PC
parser as "Phone screenshots (batch)"; emits the same `echoes-parsed` event as `CalculatorEchoParser`, so
`CalculatorEchoImporter`'s duplicate review + save flow is reused unchanged.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `phoneEchoScan.ts` | pure logic, **geometry first** (2026-09-12): `PHONE_LAYOUTS` (crop boxes + the stat table's geometry measured on a Galaxy S26 Ultra, 3120×1440; same-aspect sizes are scaled), `clusterRows` (the block pass's word boxes → rows: label words left, value column right), `labelKey` (whitespace/punctuation-insensitive stat aliases), `valueCandidates` / `legalValues` / `pickLegal` (a value is accepted only as a legal roll for its label — `subStatsTable`, `statsTable`, the fixed secondary row; "108%" is repaired to 10.8), `scanEcho` (walks the table from the known first-row position: observed rows are re-read from the raw pixels of their own row through a `BoxReader`, a row the block pass dropped is synthesized at its expected position — rows are 60 px apart, +46 after a wrapped label — and read the same way; stops at "Echo Skill"; everything doubtful lands in `flags`), `bestEcho` (drops the "Phantom:" skin prefix, scores every word-prefix of the name strip and the panel's first row, the COST breaks ties) / `bestSet`, `toParsedEcho` (the importer's shape with verbose labels). Twin of `wuwa-tools/echo-import/extract.py`, which reads the 198-shot "Wuwa Echos" album 198/198 |
| `ocr.ts` | tesseract.js worker wrapper: crop → scale → threshold / invert / plain grey / untouched colour → recognise; `recognizeWords` returns word boxes (the block pass), per-call whitelists (digits only for value re-reads) |
| `imageMatch.ts` | promise wrapper over the app's `echoParser.worker` (portrait + set-glyph pixel matching), used only as fallback when the name or the set isn't readable |
| `PhoneEchoBatchParser.vue` | the UI: multi-file input, sequential scan with progress, editable results table (echo / set / main / substats), flags per row, "Add N echoes to inventory" |
| `phoneEchoScan.test.ts` + `__fixtures__/s26UltraScanSamples.json` | replay of the word boxes and row re-reads recorded from 75 real screenshots (`wuwa-tools/echo-import/dump_scan_fixture.py`; the Python walk they come from is verified 198/198 by hand-checked records), incl. every shot whose rows had to be synthesized |
| `api/photos-album.ts`, `api/photos-image.ts`, `api/_lib/googlePhotos.ts` (+ `src/server/googlePhotos.test.ts`) | **album import (2026-09-12)**: Vercel functions (served by a Vite middleware in dev, see `vite.config.ts`) that fetch a shared Google Photos album's page and its photos same-origin — the browser cannot read either directly (HTML from another origin; no CORS header on Google's image host). Only `photos.app.goo.gl` / `photos.google.com` links and lh3 `/pw/` ids are accepted. The panel remembers per album (localStorage `wuthering-tools-plus.echoScan.albums`) which photos were added, so a later run fetches and scans only the tail; "Mark all as imported" seeds that for an album whose echoes are already in |
| `cypress/e2e/echoScanAlbum.cy.ts` | the album flow with the API stubbed (real OCR on the fixture photo): load → "1 new" → fetch & scan → add → reload shows "1 already imported · 0 new"; plus the error path |
| `skittle-theme.css` + `controller.ts` — phones (2026-09-12, B2b first cut) | below 768 px Riley's aside (README, standards, team cost, resonator search) becomes a bottom sheet behind a "Filters & options" toolbar button (backdrop / ✕ / Escape close it; the detail page hides the toolbar); desktop unchanged. E2E: `rankings.cy.ts` at 390 × 844. Still his DOM: native Vue table + detail remain the rest of B2b |
| `castMapper.ts` (2026-09-12) | every wuwa_calc cast now maps (was 10 unmatched): casts named after an echo's passive alias to their echo (Core of Collapse → Threnodian Leviathan), a resonator's own cast that wuwa_calc types as an Echo cast falls through to the kit's rows (Lucilla's Forte Echo - Oblivion), an echo with a single damage row matches per-hit without a name resemblance (Hecate = 6 × Crescent Servants — the registry's rank-5 value was corrected to the 45.59 % its own text states), and hand overrides carry kit-folded multipliers into the preset description (Cantarella's Beneath the Sea = Flowing Suffocation × 4.7 from S3; Qingxiao's Heaven's Reckoning × 2.75). Fixture `__fixtures__/wuwaCalcLoops.json` = 43 loops of 16 resonators, regenerated by `wuwa-tools/rotation-port/emit_ts_fixture.py` |
| `cypress/e2e/echoScanBatch.cy.ts` + `cypress/fixtures/echoScan/*.jpg` | real OCR end-to-end on three screenshots — two of one echo plus a Sabercat Prowler whose "8.6%" row block-only OCR used to lose (tesseract language data comes from its CDN, reference portraits from the assets CDN) |

Reading order per screenshot: name (PSM 7) → panel (PSM 6, two passes: binarised ×1.5 and greyscale ×2, rows only
the second pass saw are added and flagged) → Sonata chip (PSM 7, inverted) → if the name or set is still unknown,
the worker matches the portrait (cost-filtered) and the glyph next to +25 (among the echo's allowed sets).
Tip for users: turn a Sonata filter on in-game before shooting — the chip then prints the set name.


## Import any rotation from the Rankings page (C4) — `src/sim/rankings/`

Every team the `/rankings` detail page can show — any composition, solver state and pick, including the
compare axes — carries **"Import team into Wuthering Tools+"** in Riley's topbar (next to Back), with a
checkbox to also save each member's steady-state loop to that character's rotations.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `castMapper.ts` | TypeScript port of `wuwa-tools/rotation-port/map_rotations.py`: `appRowsOf(getCharByName(...))` / `echoRowsOf(mainEchoesData)` build the app's attack rows with level-10 motion values; `toActions()` maps executed casts through the cascade override → exact MV → aggregate → per-hit → kit ratio → tick → name-only, with `knownRatios()` pooling a kit's folded multipliers; Tune Breaks, negative-status ticks, 0-MV utility casts and cancelled echo forms are skipped and reported |
| `importFromRankings.ts` | `importTeamFromRankings(mods, rowKey, { characterRotations })`: re-runs the engine traced for the row (`runTeam(..., true)`), turns `hitsOf(line)` into casts (`CAST_NAME` / `NODE_NAME` from `@skittle/engine/stats` name the erased enums), maps the last section (the steady-state loop) per member, interleaves the actions in execution order with the main DPS in slot 0, and writes a team through `useTeamRotationsStore().importTeam` (enemy = level 100 / 20 % RES, Riley's target); optionally appends each member's loop to `characters[key].rotations` — only for characters already set up in this app |
| `controller.ts` | `mountImportControls(key)` after every `renderDetail`; `runImport()` → toast with the outcome (`data-test-rankings-import-done` carries the new team id for tests) |
| `castMapper.test.ts` + `__fixtures__/wuwaCalcLoops.json` | the port must reproduce the Python mapper on 33 of Riley's loops (930 casts, 12 resonators incl. ratio-, tick-, per-hit- and override-heavy kits) |

The generated stock presets (`src/sim/presets/`) remain the zero-click path for the best teams; this is the
everything-else path.


## "My build" in the Substat Investment compare — `src/sim/rankings/myBuilds.ts`

Riley's Substats compare offers two spreads per resonator: his default (ChemX32) and High Invest. The
plus site adds a third row, **My build**: the substat rolls on the five echoes that character has
equipped in this app's calculator, run through his engine like any other pick.

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| `myBuilds.ts` | pure: `buildRollsOf(characters, inventoryEchoes)` resolves each character's `echoes[slot].echoId` against the inventory (`resolveCharacterEchoes`) and turns the five echoes' substats into `{ kind, value }` rolls in his `Substat` names (Healing Bonus has no counterpart and is skipped); `rollsKey()` tells one build from the next |
| `controller.ts` | `mountRankings(host, router, builds)` / `updateMyBuilds(builds)`: registers every build on the page's loadouts (`setMySubstat` + `customSubstats("My build", rolls)`) and posts `{ type: "mySubstats" }` to every solver worker — the worker is what builds the rows, so it has to know too |
| `solver.worker.ts` | intercepts that message ahead of Riley's `onmessage` |
| `RankingsView.vue` | computes the builds from the character + inventory stores and re-registers on change |
| fork `davidbeck45/wuwa_calc` branch `plus` | the engine side: `Loadout.mySubstat/mySubstatKey`, `customSubstats()`, `setMySubstat()`, a third entry in `buildsOf` when the axis is open, `.uKEY` in combo keys, "My build" labels, and the table grouping / twin / baseline rules for the new pick (`page/table.ts`, `rowFromKey` in `page/model.ts`) |

Only resonators with a build in the app get the row (`#r=Cartethyia&cb=Cartethyia` after an import
shows it; Mornye without one does not). The row keys carry the build's hash, so a changed build gets fresh
solves, and a `#team=` link to a stale one falls back to the table. E2E: `cypress/e2e/rankings.cy.ts`.

## My roster rankings (phase E) — `src/sim/myRankings/`

`/my-rankings` (linked from the credit line on `/rankings`, and back): the app's own damage engine ranks the
characters and teams YOU have set up — real weapon, echoes, chains and buffs — the way Riley's table ranks his
solved picks.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `rankRoster.ts` | pure/async `rankRoster(characters, echoes, teams, { investment, onProgress })`: for every character with a weapon (`isSetUp`) it scores every saved rotation, curated preset and wuwa_calc preset with `calcCharacterRotationDamage` on the active build and keeps the best; `investment` re-scores the best rotation with the next sequence node's chains on (first entry of a node when it has variants — an estimate) and with the weapon at R5; teams = your teams with actions + wuwa_calc / curated team presets whose three members are set up, through `calcTeamRotationDamage`. Enemy fixed at level 100 / 20 % RES (`RANKING_ENEMY`, Riley's target) so the numbers sit beside `/rankings` |
| `MyRankingsView.vue` | the page: auto-computes on first visit (cached in module state, recomputed when the stores change), progress bar, two tables with bars, next-S / R5 deltas, empty state, wuwa_calc ⇄ My roster switch |
| `rankRoster.test.ts` + `__fixtures__/cartethyiaAccount.json` | a real exported account (the Cartethyia optimizer fixture) ranks her own, curated and wuwa_calc rotations on her build; unknown ids and weaponless characters are skipped |
| `cypress/e2e/myRankings.cy.ts` | empty state + links, then an imported account ranked in-page |

Metric: average damage per rotation (DPR). DPS appears only when a rotation carries a duration.
